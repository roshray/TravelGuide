# TravelGuide
This is repository contains the files of Travel Guide project.

The folder Sample-Datasets contains two owl(web ontology language) files which stores data about some of the famous places in India. These files were created by an open source ontology editor called Protege developed by Stanford University(http://protege.stanford.edu/). The data for the ontologies were extracted from various travel sites like trip-adivsor,goibibo,etc., manually and by using python scrapy scripts. These owl files are then uploaded into Apache Jena Fuseki Server which stores, manages, executes queries and fetches results from the uploaded ontologies.
